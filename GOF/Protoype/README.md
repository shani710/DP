# Prototype Design Pattern

## Overview

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the creation of new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is useful when the cost of creating a new object is more efficient through copying an existing object rather than creating it from scratch.

## Intent

The main intent of the Prototype Design Pattern is to provide a mechanism for creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, rather than creating them from scratch. This pattern is especially beneficial when the cost of creating a new object is expensive or when the object creation process is complex.

## Structure

The Prototype Design Pattern typically involves the following components:

- **Prototype:** This is the interface or abstract class that declares the method for cloning itself.

- **ConcretePrototype:** This is the class that implements the `Cloneable` interface and provides the implementation for cloning itself.

- **Client:** This is the class that creates new objects by copying an existing prototype.
