# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Overview

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It defines an interface for creating a set of related or dependent objects, and multiple concrete factories implementing this interface produce objects that are compatible with each other.

## Intent

The main intent of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern is to provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is useful when a system should be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented, and the system is configured with multiple families of objects.

## Structure

The Abstract Factory Design Pattern typically involves the following components:

- **Abstract Factory:** This is the interface or abstract class that declares the creation methods for various abstract products, which are related or dependent.

- **Concrete Factory:** These are the classes that implement the `Abstract Factory` interface, creating products that belong to a specific family.

- **Abstract Product:** This is the interface or abstract class that declares the common interface for a family of products.

- **Concrete Product:** These are the classes that implement the `Abstract Product` interface, providing specific functionality for a family of products.
